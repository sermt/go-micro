// Goroutines are a powerful feature of Go that allow for concurrent programming.
// They are lightweight, easy to use, and can significantly improve the performance of your applications.
// In this example, we create a simple goroutine that prints a message to the console.
// The program waits for user input to prevent it from exiting immediately, allowing the goroutine to run.
// Goroutines are managed by the Go runtime, which handles scheduling and execution.
// This makes them a great choice for building scalable and efficient applications.
// Goroutines can be used for a variety of tasks, such as handling network requests, processing data, and performing background tasks.
// They are a key part of Go's concurrency model and are widely used in Go applications.
